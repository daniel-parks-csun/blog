## Using Group Policy to Distribute SSL Certificates

Sometimes you will have many computers in your environment, and they will need access to certain programs or data sources which require a secure connection. Using Active Directory Domain Services, we can push certificates to client computers using Group Policy Objects. 

1. Open Group Policy Management

2. Create a new GPO and make sure it is part of the correct domain or OU. If it isn't, you won't be able to distribute the certificates to the machines you want.

3. Edit the Group Policy Object and import Trusted Root Certificate Authorities. You can find this under "Computer Configuration/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Public Key Policies".

4. A wizard will appear guiding you through the steps to import your Certificate. You should store your Certificate in an organized and secure location.

5. Next, you will need to add the Certificate(s) to the Certificate Store. Follow the instructions in the wizard to do so when you get to the Certificate Store page.

You then repeat the above steps to apply certificates to your Federation servers within the network. After that is complete, you will be able to distribute the certificates within your domain to any machine, according to rules applied in Group Policy. This will streamline access to secure sites or data stores that use SSL Certificates.
