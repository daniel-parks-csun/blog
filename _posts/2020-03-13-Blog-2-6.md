## Setup Plex media server on Debian based linux

Plex is a media server that can host files to your client wherever you are, from home. To start, make sure Debian is installed and you have permission to install packages.

## Step 1: Get curl to add the Plex APT repo to Debian

```
sudo apt install curl

curl https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key | sudo apt-key add -

echo deb https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb ./public main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plexmediaserver.list
```

## Step 2: Install the latest version of Plex Media Server

```
sudo apt update

sudo apt install plexmediaserver
```

## Step 3: Verify Plex Installation

```
sudo systemctl status plexmediaserver
```

The output should list the status as 'Active'. It will also list a Main PID and the number of Tasks associated with the service running.

## Step 4: Firewall Configuration

First, use the following command to download UFW, which allows you to better manage your systems firewall.

```
sudo apt install ufw
```

Next, make a ufw configuration profile file. This will enable certain ports to be used with Plex.

```
[plexmediaserver]
title=Plex Media Server (Standard)
description=The Plex Media Server
ports=32400/tcp|3005/tcp|5353/udp|8324/tcp|32410:32414/udp

[plexmediaserver-dlna]
title=Plex Media Server (DLNA)
description=The Plex Media Server (additional DLNA capability only)
ports=1900/udp|32469/tcp

[plexmediaserver-all]
title=Plex Media Server (Standard + DLNA)
description=The Plex Media Server (with additional DLNA capability)
ports=32400/tcp|3005/tcp|5353/udp|8324/tcp|32410:32414/udp|1900/udp|32469/tcp
```

To enable this configuration file and update the firewall, run the following:

```
sudo ufw app update plexmediaserver
sudo ufw allow 22
sudo ufw allow plexmediaserver-all
```

Now Plex is ready to run and serve content properly over the network.

## Step 5: Configure storage for Plex

The next step is to create a space to store your content.

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/plexmedia/movies

sudo mkdir -p /opt/plexmedia/shows

sudo mkdir -p /opt/plexmedia/familyrecordings
```

Then enable access to the directory so Plex can serve the content.

```
sudo chown -R plex: /opt/plexmedia
```

## Final Step: Access your server!

Finally, head to http://serverip:32400/web and follow the instructions to finalize your personal Plex server and begin uploading content for access wherever.
