Working with remote technologies is a interesting, powerful, and sometimes difficult process. Usually you need to interface with these technologies through a command line interface, and understanding the syntax is key.

Previously in my COMP484 with Kaplan, we wrote javascript with ajax to connect remotely to a Phillips light, and then play a light show. This project was simple enough, but required reading and understanding the API provided by Phillips. Each technology vendor may do things differently, so the primary skill exercised in that lab was the ability to learn and adapt to a new technology, and accomplish our goal of playing a blinking, colored, light show.

During the light show project, our script used ajax to establish a connection using a socket that we created. Once a connection was established, sending commands was easy enough but the syntax needed to be perfect to interface properly with the light bulb. There were many times where we had to change how we had hoped to control the lights due to learning a better, more efficient way to send instructions to the bulb. 

In the end, learning about how different web technologies can communicate, as well as how unique APIs can be digested and used to accomplish your goals is great.
