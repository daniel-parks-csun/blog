## Setup your own Print Server on a Debian using CUPS

CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) allows you to create a print server quick and easily on many Unix platforms. For CUPS to work, your system must be able to print to the printers you wish to serve.

## Step 1: Update your system!

```
sudo su
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```

## Step 2: Install CUPS

```
apt-get install cups
```

## Step 3: Configure your 'cupsd.conf' file

Edit the file to listen on whatever port you specify, and to allow communication with whatever network ranges you prefer. Here is how I set up my 'cupsd.conf' file:

```
# /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
Listen *:49600

<Location /printers>
    Order allow,deny
    Allow 192.168.0.*
    Allow 192.168.1.*
    Allow 192.168.2.*
</Location>
```

## Step 4: Restart Server process

To allow Windows machines to print using our new server, we will serve requests through http. To do this, we will install Samba.

```
aptitude install samba
```

## Step 5: Restart Server process

Restart the server process anytime you make changes to the configuration file. If this is your first setup, this will start the process.

```
/etc/init.d/cups restart
```

## Step 6: Access your server!

You can now print to your printer as long as you access it at the following address:

```
http://<ip address>:<port>/printers/<printer name>
```

In the above, make sure to replace <ip address> with your IP, <port> with the port you told CUPS to listen on, and <printer name> with the specified printer name.
