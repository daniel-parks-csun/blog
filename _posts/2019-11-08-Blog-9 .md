## Explaining Cron Jobs

A cron job is a task scheduler for linux systems. It can schedule a task to execute at a specified time, and repeat at a specified interval. 

The name of the tool used to edit the cron jobs file is called crontab. The list can be opened with a text editor using the following command:

```
crontab -e
```

You will be prompted to use a text editor to edit the file. The file consists of cron jobs in the following format:

```
m h dom mon dow user command
```

m = the minute on which the job will run, 0 - 59

h = the hour on which the job will run, 0 - 23

dom = the day of the month on which the job will run, 1 - 31

mon = the month on which the job will run, 1 - 12

dow = the day of the week on which the job will run, 0 - 6 beginning on sunday

user = the user which will run the job (needs priviledges)

command = the command to execute

## Cron Job Examples

```
30 * * * * root /usr/bin/php /var/www/html/project/script.php
```

This job runs a script at the specified directory every 30 minutes.

```
0 6 1 Jan,Mar,May,Jul,Sep,Nov * root command
```

This job executes at 6:00am every 1st day of the months of January, March, May, July, September, and November.

CronJobs can be used to accomplish loads of tasks automatically. Tasks that are regularly repeated or ones with specific time restraits on execution are particularly well suited for CronJobs.
