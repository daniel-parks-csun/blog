In Lab 1, we begin using containers to build a LAMP Stack. LAMP includes Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. These components allow you to serve information on the internet, create and manage databases, execute scripts server side, and much more.

First, we created a docker container and utilized the -p flag to map a port on the host os to a port in the container guest os. This will be used when you need to communicate in and out of the container.

Then we utilize apt-get command to install a number of packages, including updates for the Ubuntu system, a text editor, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. The installation can be verified by running apache and accessing the webpage served on the port which was mapped to when the container was created. Once we have APache and PHP up and running, we can clone applications into our container and serve them on the internet.

It may seem like nothing special, but the magic is in the nature of a docker container. Once these steps are complete, we are able to wrap the container up in a file that can be shared with other docker users. This allows them to rebuild the same container environment you created. This allows you to have syncronized developer environments, or ensure a consistent application usability when pushed to production.
