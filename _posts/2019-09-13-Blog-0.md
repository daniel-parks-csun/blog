Welcome to my blog. I will use this space to articulate a technical perspective of something I worked on each week.

During the first week of our CIT480 class, we were tasked with setting up Docker and gaining initial familiarity with it. Docker creates, manages, and utilizes containers, which are a form of virtualization.

Previously, I have worked with Hypervisors / Virtual Machine Monitors, which emulate everything from the hardware up. There are advantages to using a Hypervisor approach to virtualization: VMM's allow you to segment hardware resources efficiently according to how they will be used. 

Containers allow you to create guest operating systems that share the base shystem's kernal. This allows virtualization to be thinner than a Hypervisor approach where hardware is emulated. This method has less processing overhead and allows for one-way isolation of process information (as the host os can see processes of each container, but the guest os within each container can only see their own processes).

We have only started using docker, but it is clear how useful a light-weight, scalable and sharable form of virtualization can be.
